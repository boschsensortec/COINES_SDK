* Shrunk the COINES Linux installer to less than 3 MB (Used the Linux distro's runtime Qt libraries)
* Added support for keeping multiple versions of COINES
* COINES examples kept in C:\Users\%USER%\COINES_examples moved to %COINES_INSTALL_PATH%\examples  
  
Known Issues
* Loss of packets being observed sometimes during streaming (varies with CPU Load)
* BMI08x - Initial few packets are missing during streaming
* BME280 - SPI & I2C switching might be inconsistent with  examples

COINES v0.6 - Beta (21-05-2018)

Updates
* New simple GUI editor for compiling and running examples.
* Got rid of GNU coreutils introduced in v0.5.3-beta release
* Fixed - Random data corruption when streaming for long periods.
* Optimizations in coinesAPI library 
  - USB Buffer changed to 4kB
  - Number of asynchronous bulk USB transfers increased to 3 (for improved throughput)
* Used COINES_I2C_FAST_MODE (400kHz I2C) in BMI08x examples
* Nearly zero packet loss in Linux


Known Issues
* Use of 400kHz I2C mode(fast mode) can cause loss of bytes in the packet randomly during streaming
* Initial packets (approx. 1 to 20) are lost during interrupt streaming (Both Windows & Linux)
* Loss of packets being observed sometimes during streaming in Windows (varies with CPU Load)
* COINES GUI for Linux is supported only on 64-bit distros
* Power cycling might be required everytime before running interrupt streaming and data sync streaming example programs in BMI085
* Data Streaming might be inconsistent with Virtual machine linux environment. It is recommended not to use VM for COINES testing for linux

COINES v0.5.3 - Beta (30-04-2018)

Updates
* Example code can now be compiled with TDM-GCC-32/64 using mingw32-make 
  http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/ - No more messing with proxies :-)
* Few GNU Coreutils included as part of COINES installer
  (Had to include it because TDM-GCC package comes with GCC only)
* BHy examples folder structure changed
* Data corruption issue fixed during streaming
* No need of recompiling libcoines.a in 32-bit Windows (Issue in v0.5.1-beta)
* Added Doxygen comments and improved readabilty of coinesAPI library
* Hard coded GCC installation paths removed in Makefiles
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

COINES v0.5.2 - Beta (06-04-2018)

Updates
* Cleaned up example code,coinesAPI code and Makefiles
* Renamed USB driver
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

v0.5.1 - Beta (22-03-2018)

Updates
* Fixed - Programs were unable to run from MinGW prompt
* Simplified example code Makefiles
* Added a util - Bash script for installing MinGW toolchain when behind proxy
* Additionally tested with Raspberry Pi 3 (Debian Jessie)
* Supports 32-bit Windows.
* Updated BMI08x Data Sync. example and doc

Known Issues
* Recompile libcoines.a in 32-bit Windows after installation to build examples

COINES v0.5 - Beta (14-03-2018)

Feature
* Examples for BMI08x,BME280,BHY sensors included
* Compatible with Development Desktop  APP 2.0 (DD2.0) hardware
* Works with Windows and Linux.
* Uses libusb-1.0 for both Windows and Linux
* Tested with following enviroments
	* Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and 16.04
	* Fedora 27
	* CentOS 7

Known Issues
* Sometimes board need to be turned off and on as it sometimes goes to undefined state.
* 64-bit version of Windows is only supported currently.
* User needs to manually switch between DD2.0 USB driver and COINES USB driver to use the respective application.
* DD2.0 firmware is not shipped with installer. Flash the DD2.0 firmware from DD2.0 software package.
