================ Bosch Sensortec COINES_SDK =====================================

This package contains the Bosch Sensortec COINES_SDK (COmmunication with 
INertial and Environmental Sensors) sensor evaluation software.

The software provides a low-level interface to Bosch Sensortec's 
Application Board APP3.X. The user can access Bosch Sensortec's MEMS 
sensors through a C interface. COINES_SDK can be used with the SensorAPI 
of the sensor, which can be obtained from 
https://github.com/BoschSensortec. Source code of 
sample applications is provided with the COINES_SDK library as 
a package. The user can modify, compile and run the sample applications. 

COINES_SDK can be used to see how to use the SensorAPI in an embedded 
environment and allows convenient data logging.
